Well, aren't I brilliant. Copied the source code for the wrong component.
Although not a compelte disaster - the correct component and the component I used yester have a common ancestor, 
it does mean a backward step while I mess about.
In a nutshell, I got the wrong source, because I was looking at the deployed item in the production RPi yesterday.
The item has files 'mqtt-dynamic' which gave me a bum result when I googled them.

Instead of getting:

https://github.com/sajayantony/node-red-contrib-mqtt-dynamic  (wrong one)

I should have found:

https://github.com/xTheRamon/node-red-contrib-mqtt-dynamictopic (correct one)

'Dynamic Topic' supports an input wire, which tells it the topic to subscribe to. 'Dynamic' has no input wire.
This caused my flow to suddenly drop all its input wires when I deployed it.

Live and learn...!

OK, so, I'll now check for Pahoe websockets support, and if all goes well, will make exactly the same changes as before, to accept a schema in the node set-up.

1. We have 'production' RPi, which is wired up to Pi-Scalextric. 
1. We have 'dev' RPi which is flashed with clean Raspbian 'Buster'.
1. On 'dev'
1. set up mac, router and vs code, with remote connection to RPi: see [here](https://github.com/aliceliveprojects/little_blue_pi/blob/master/documentation/worklogs/27.01.2020.md) 
1. set up VNC on RPi
1. set up github on RPi
1. copied https://github.com/sajayantony/node-red-contrib-mqtt-dynamic into this repo
1. On 'production' 
    * use Node-RED to copy all flows to clipboard. Creat text file, paste the resulting JSON in and save to USB stick.
1. On 'production', go to ~./.node-red and copy the package.json file to  USB stick
1. On 'dev':
1. copy USB files to /node-red-contrib-mqtt-dynamic-master/docs/node_red/

---

1. we need to install the code from this repo.
1. first, rename the node in the package.json file. I renamed it to: node-red-contrib-alice-mqtt-dynamic, this is to stop any clash with the published node.
1. next, see: https://nodered.org/docs/creating-nodes/first-node
1. in terminal:  `cd ~/.node-red`
1. in terminal, bring up the file manager: `pcmanfm .`  go to the repo, and copy the <repo path>
1. in terminal, `npm install <repo path>
1. This will install node-red-contrib-alice-mqtt-dynamic as a node in the Node-RED palette manager

--- 

1. We need to install the same dependencies as those on the 'production' RPi:
1. using the programmer's file editor on the RPi, edit the package.json file from the **copied** files, and select the depencies. Copy them into the package.json file in ~/.node-red.
1. should see something like this:

```json
{
    "name": "node-red-project",
    "description": "A Node-RED Project",
    "version": "0.0.1",
    "private": true,
    "dependencies": {
        "node-red-contrib-alice-mqtt-dynamic": "file:../Documents/github/mqtt/node-red-contrib-mqtt-dynamic-master",
        "node-red-contrib-gpio": "~0.14.0",
        "node-red-contrib-grovepi": "~0.1.8",
        "node-red-contrib-ibm-watson-iot": "^0.2.8",
        "node-red-contrib-play-audio": "^2.3.2",
        "node-red-node-ping": "0.0.16",
        "node-red-node-random": "^0.1.2",
        "node-red-node-serialport": "^0.6.8",
        "node-red-node-smooth": "^0.1.0"
    }
}

```

1. In terminal: `cd ~/.node-red`
1. In terminal: `npm install`
1. should install all dependencies to Node-RED

---

1. start node red as normal, using 

```bash
start-node-red
```

1. in node-RED import the flow from https://github.com/aliceliveprojects/pi_scalextric_mqtt/blob/master/node_red_flow/mqtt_flow.json
1. The file should import successfully, with no complaints.
1. The nodes using mqtt-dynamic may well need attention, so simply use the dashboard to locate any nodes with warning indicators, and make sure the properties have the correct values.

----

1. set up VS code for attaching to a node instance.
1. In vscode, set up a launch.json file:

```json
{
    // Use IntelliSense to learn about possible attributes.
    // Hover to view descriptions of existing attributes.
    // For more information, visit: https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=830387
    "version": "0.2.0",
    "configurations": [
        {
            "type": "node",
            "request": "launch",
            "name": "Launch Program",
            "skipFiles": [
                "<node_internals>/**"
            ],
            "program": "${workspaceFolder}/mqtt-dynamic.js"
        },
        {
            "name": "Attach to Process",
            "type": "node",
            "request": "attach",
            "port": 9222
        }

    ]
}
```

1. 


1. start node red, debugging in VSCode:

1. This is mean to work, but I couldn't get VSCode to update the list of nodejs processes properly.It would come up with some, but not the one I'd just started with node-red-start.

read this to get some context:

---

see: https://it.knightnet.org.uk/kb/nr-qa/vscode-debugger/ - thanks to Julian Knight.

1. add this to launch.json:

```json
        {
            "type": "node",
            "request": "attach",
            "name": "AttachtoProcess",
            "processId": '${command:PickProcess}'
        }
```

1. Start up Node-RED then click on the green “start debugging” icon in VSCode, you will get a popup to choose the active process you want to debug. All Node.js based processes will be listed. Pick the one that is Node-RED.

1. Having chosen, the debugger may pause things, if so, click on the continue icon or press F5.

1. To debug your own (or someone else’s) node, expand the “Loaded Scripts” list in the sidebar, find the appropriate script file, click on it to open. Now you can set breakpoints by clicking to the left of the line numbers.

1. When the execution hits a breakpoint, you will see the current call stack, variables and more.

---

instead, I rather messily did this:

1. using VNC start the Task Manager on the RPi. Filter on 'node'
1. in terminal: `node-red-start'
1. look at the new node process - there will be one which immediately allocates about 100MB
1. note the PID

In VS code: edit the lunch.json file:

1. add this to launch.json:

```json
        {
            "type": "node",
            "request": "attach",
            "name": "AttachtoProcess",
            "processId": "<the pid>"
        }
```

for instance:

```json
        {
            "type": "node",
            "request": "attach",
            "name": "AttachtoProcess",
            "processId": "4732"
        }
```

-- it's a string, not a number.

Once you've connected, you can break on the the code.

For example:

1. go to 'loaded scripts'.
1. there's an empty item. expand this.
1. You'll find you can navigate into the `/node-red-contrib-mqtt-dynamic-master` folder
1. put a break point in, around line 220 of mqtt-dynamic.js: 

```javascript
} else if (node.connecting) {
    node.log(RED._("mqtt.state.connect-failed",{broker:(node.clientid?node.clientid+"@":"")+node.brokerurl}));
}
```

this will get hit, as the code will not be able to connect to the mqtt broker - if it's not available.

My code is breaking here, so I know the debugger is working OK.
